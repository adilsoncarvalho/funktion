# funktion

Simple microservice built using GCP Cloud Function

## Development environment

It's development environment runs on top of Docker and to get it up and running you must build it

    docker-compose build

Then you can run the server

    docker-compose run --rm funktion

If you need to access `bash`, `npm`, etc. you can just lunch a container as follows

    docker-compose run --rm funktion [bash|npm|etc.]

## Consuming

Consider using some tool like [httpie](https://httpie.org)

    http localhost:5000/funktion
    http localhost:5000/funktion/user
    http localhost:5000/funktion/user/1
    http POST localhost:5000/funktion/user/1 name="John Doe"

## Benchmark

I've used Apache Benchmark.
