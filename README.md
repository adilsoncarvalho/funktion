# funktion

Simple microservice built using GCP Cloud Function

## Development environment

It's development environment runs on top of Docker and to get it up and running you must build it

    docker build -t funktion .

Then you can run the server

    docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/app" -p "5000:5000" funktion

> By using the `-v` option we mount our filesystem, so any change you make on the code will be reloaded by [nodemon](https://nodemon.io)

If you need to access `bash`, `npm`, etc. you can just lunch a container as follows

    docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/app" -p "5000:5000" -ti funktion [bash|npm|etc.]

> You can remove the `-v` if you don't want to change the source files on your machine or the `-p` if you are not willing to connect to the container

## Benchmark

I've used Apache Benchmark.
